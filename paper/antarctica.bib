Variations in travel velocities at different locations bend the minimum time paths away from regions of high congestion. This paper discusses a transformation of the urban plane into a time surface on which distance corresponds to travel time, and describes the construction of minimum paths and isochrones for various velocity fields. This view of the urban transportation system allows us to discover some of the important features which are often hidden in a network description of the system.},

  abstract = {Surfacic networks are structures built upon a 2D manifold. Many systems, including transportation networks and various urban networks, fall into this category. The fluctuations of node elevations imply significant deviations from typical plane networks and require specific tools to understand their impact. Here, we present such tools, including lazy paths that minimize elevation differences, graph arduousness which measures the tiring nature of shortest paths (SPs), and the excess effort, which characterizes positive elevation variations along SPs. We illustrate these measures using toy models of surfacic networks and empirically examine pedestrian networks in selected cities. Specifically, we examine how changes in elevation affect the spatial distribution of betweenness centrality. We also demonstrate that the excess effort follows a nontrivial power law distribution, with an exponent that is not universal, which illustrates that there is a significant probability of encountering steep slopes along SPs, regardless of the elevation difference between the starting point and the destination. These findings highlight the significance of elevation fluctuations in shaping network characteristics. Surfacic networks offer a promising framework for comprehensively analyzing and modeling complex systems that are situated on or constrained to a surface environment.},

In relation to Antarctica, the closest definition has been `the spatial extent and intensity of disturbance'. Yet there is still confusion around what a `disturbance' footprint is actually measuring. This is evident within Committee for Environmental Protection documents, in which there have been over 80 mentions of footprint, with at least eight different meanings, since 1998. To improve clarity in its use by both scientists and policymakers, we first examine the development of the term footprint, how it has been applied, and its usefulness in applications such as interpreting `minor or transitory' activities. We then identify and define a suite of footprint types (disturbance, building, contamination, non-native species, noise, visual, visitation, risk, carbon, ecological, and human), with the aim of developing a common understanding of what the term refers to. Our goal is to ensure the concept of footprint can be a useful environmental tool to facilitate progressing environmental protection.},

Here, we report the footprint of all buildings to be {$>$}390,000\,m2, with an additional disturbance footprint of {$>$}5,200,000\,m2 just on ice-free land. These create a visual footprint similar in size to the total ice-free area of Antarctica, and impact over half of all large coastal ice-free areas. Our data demonstrate that human impacts are disproportionately concentrated in some of the most sensitive environments, with consequential implications for conservation management. This high-resolution measurement of the extent of infrastructure across the continent can be used to inform management decisions to balance sustainable scientific use and environmental protection of the Antarctic environment.},

  abstract = {While the benefits of GIS are widely touted among archaeologists today, less attention has been paid to the potential pitfalls and drawbacks of this undeniably important methodological tool. One of the greatest challenges of geospatial modeling is unbalanced data: due to the nature of the archaeological record, we can never assume that the remnants of past behavioral processes we are working with constitute a fully representative sample. Rather, our datasets are reflective of differential social and natural preservation conditions, as well as research biases. Most regional geospatial studies must collate diverse data collected over decades by researchers with varying backgrounds and goals, using assorted spatial scales and levels of technological sophistication. Such factors contribute substantial uncertainty to our models, uncertainty that should be recognized, quantified, and mitigated. If GIS techniques are to continue shifting the way we conduct archaeology and improve our abilities to answer questions regarding past behavior, then we must question the infallibility of GIS as a methodological tool and direct more attention toward developing robust geospatial applications that can meet the idiosyncratic needs of archaeological analysis. This paper explores one example of how such uncertainty investigation can be conducted.},

  abstract = {Complexity science refers to the theoretical research perspectives and the formal modelling tools designed to study complex systems. A complex system consists of separate entities interacting following a set of (often simple) rules that collectively give rise to unexpected patterns featuring vastly different properties than the entities that produced them. In recent years a number of case studies have shown that such approaches have great potential for furthering our understanding of the past phenomena explored in Roman Studies. We argue complexity science and formal modelling have great potential for Roman Studies by offering four key advantages: (1) the ability to deal with emergent properties in complex Roman systems; (2) the means to formally specify theories about past Roman phenomena; (3) the power to test aspects of these theories as hypotheses using formal modelling approaches; and (4) the capacity to do all of this in a transparent, reproducible, and cumulative scientific framework. We present a ten-point manifesto that articulates arguments for the more common use in Roman Studies of perspectives, concepts and tools from the broader field of complexity science, which are complementary to empirical inductive approaches. There will be a need for constant constructive collaboration between Romanists with diverse fields of expertise in order to usefully embed complexity science and formal modelling in Roman Studies.},

Among the many factors that affect travel rates along an escape route, landscape conditions such as slope, lowlying vegetation density, and ground surface roughness are particularly influential, and can be measured using airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. In order to develop a robust, quantitative understanding of the effects of these landscape conditions on travel rates, we performed an experiment wherein study participants were timed while walking along a series of transects within a study area dominated by grasses, sagebrush and juniper. We compared resultant travel rates to LiDAR-derived estimates of slope, vegetation density and ground surface roughness using linear mixed effects modelling to quantify the relationships between these landscape conditions and travel rates. The best-fit model revealed significant negative relationships between travel rates and each of the three landscape conditions, suggesting that, in order of decreasing magnitude, as density, slope and roughness increase, travel rates decrease. Model coefficients were used to map travel impedance within the study area using LiDAR data, which enabled mapping the most efficient routes from fire crew locations to safety zones and provided an estimate of travel time.},

  abstract = {One of the critical factors affecting travel rates while hiking, jogging, or running along a trail is the slope of the underlying terrain. Models for predicting this effect have been used in a wide variety of scientific and applied contexts, including recreation planning, search and rescue, wildland firefighter safety, social network analysis, and recreating historical human movement patterns. Despite their wide use, these models are based on datasets with very small sample sizes that were collected without using instantaneous measures of travel rate and assume symmetrical effects about the slope of maximum travel rate. These models also typically resulted in a single mathematical function, ignoring the significant variability that can occur between a fast and a slow individual, or between walking and running travel rates. In this study we modeled travel rates using a database of GPS tracks from 29,928 individuals representing 421,247 individual hikes, jogs, and runs on trails in and around Salt Lake City, Utah for an entire year between July 1, 2016 and June 30, 2017. Three widely-used probability distribution functions (Laplace, Gauss, and Lorentz) were used to predict travel rates based on terrain slope along segments of trails with uniform slopes. To account for the variability in travel rates between fast and slow movement, a series of travel rate models were generated to predict travel rate percentiles, ranging from the 1st to the 99th, thus providing a flexible basis for predicting travel rates as a function of slope. The large number of samples allowed us to introduce a novel term that accounts for asymmetry in travel rates on uphill and downhill slopes. All three functions performed well, with Lorentz percentile models averaging an R2 of 0.958 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.078 m/s, Laplace with R2 of 0.953 and MAE of 0.088 m/s, and Gauss with R2 of 0.949 and MAE of 0.090 m/s. All three functions performed notably better at estimating lower travel rate percentiles (e.g. 5th: R2Lorentz = 0.941; R2Laplace = 0.940; R2Gauss = 0.934) as compared to higher (e.g. 95th: R2Lorentz = 0.914; R2Laplace = 0.913; R2Gauss = 0.908), indicating greater consistency in walking rates than the fastest running rates. Lorentz outperformed the other functions for the widest range of percentiles (5th, 30th-90th), and thus is recommended for use as a flexible travel rate prediction function. However, Laplace tended to produce the best results at moderately-low travel rate percentiles (10th-25th), suggesting a combination of the two models could produce the highest accuracies. The results of this research provide a sound basis for future studies aiming to estimate travel rates while hiking or running along slopes.},

  abstract = {Geographical concepts and technologies are highly valued and have found useful applications in a wide range of geographical disciplines. Unfortunately there is a lack of communication between disciplines such as landscape ecology and transport geography. This presents a barrier to addressing geographical issues such as the spread of organisms, which in some instances require an integrated geography approach. In an attempt to encourage integrated geographical research on organism spread, that uses existing research from landscape ecology and transport geography, an integrated conceptual and technical framework is presented that could be used to produce maps that differentiate areas based on their spread potential. Conceptually, the terms patch connectivity and accessibility are recognised as being near identical in scope, and as such are suggested a useful basis for approaching the integration of movement modelling used in landscape ecology and transport geography. Technically, this integration can be achieved using modelling methodologies established in both disciplines, as the graph theory-based shortest path Dijkstra's Algorithm used in transport geography is demonstrated to be equivalent to raster GIS least-cost modelling used in landscape ecology. This conceptual and technical common ground has been used to create an analytical approach based on catchment areas that can map differing levels of spread potential across a landscape. A demonstration of how these graph theory methods can also be integrated to map spread potential as a combined function of both organism dispersal and transportation is also provided. The practical challenges and assumptions in applying the methodology are also highlighted, and to facilitate understanding and further development of the approach presented, example scripts and data for producing maps of spread potential are provided for use with a variety of software.},

The resultant set of vectors, each of which shows the residual displacement between a point in time space and physical space, is used as the basis of a fast, objective procedure for interpolating any other points or lines in the time space. This enables such things to be shown as the time-space distortion of an urban street network or of a square graticule from physical space. The process can also be reversed so that, for example, the solution points of a facility location problem solved in time space can be converted to their equivalent locations in physical space.},

Such functions are becoming more useful as apps for route guidance proliferate. Numerous practical issues are raised by any effort to validate these functions empirically. Hiking functions in general allow routes to be measured on various criteria, including travel time, travel distance, or energy consumption, yet, few efforts have been made to calibrate similar functions for other modes of travel, other traveler profiles, and other route criteria. Connected and autonomous vehicles raise the possibility that route choice may take on greater significance in the context of system-wide goals, rather than the current individual self-interest.},

The project papers are accompanied by invited chapters presenting case studies and reflections from other parts of the Roman Empire focusing on the themes of subsistence economy, demography, transport and mobility, and socio-economic networks in the Roman period. The book shows the added value of state-of-the-art computer modelling techniques and bridges computational and conventional approaches. Topics that will be of particular interest to archaeologists are the question of (forced) surplus production, the demographic and economic effects of the Roman occupation on the local population, and the structuring of transport networks and settlement patterns. For modellers, issues of sensitivity analysis and validation of modelling results are specifically addressed.

This article calls on archaeological GIS practitioners to carry existing GIS theory and critique to another level. It also argues that the critique of the epistemological implications of GIS use in archaeology has largely (and at times rather implicitly) been structured by representational thinking habits and that a move to non-representational thinking would provide novel considerations of the technology.},

Therefore several slope-dependent cost functions for walkers and vehicles are discussed. Slope is often combined with some other factor, so the different methods for combining cost components are compared.

  abstract = {Each model of past movement based on historical and archaeological evidence nowadays relies implicitly or explicitly on a cost function estimating costs of movement in terms of time, calories or some other currency for the study area and period of time considered. Cost functions are the basis of two popular GIS-based areas of spatial analysis in archaeology: site catchments and least-cost paths. A site catchment is the region accessible from a site, and often archaeological studies analyse the resources within this region. A least-cost path (LCP) is the route minimizing the costs of movement between two given locations. In archaeological studies, the aim of LCP calculations is often to reconstruct ancient routes or a route network or to identify the principal factors governing the construction of known roads or road segments. For generating a site catchment, GIS programs compute an accumulated cost surface (ACS). This is also the first step for LCP generation; therefore, the Dijkstra algorithm implemented in most GIS programs for this purpose is outlined. The cost function applied for calculating the ACS typically depends on slope, soil type, vegetation cover or the presence of streams. Several slope-dependent cost functions and a list of terrain factors are presented. Moreover, issues with least-cost applications are discussed, including barrier implementation, restricted number of possible movement directions, and the calculation of slope-based costs for a path taken in one or two directions. The aim of the case study is to compare the site catchments of a Roman farm and a temple at different scales based on a cost model derived from Roman roads. The concluding section discusses validation and stability of the outcomes of the methods presented and some additional issues such as modelling movement beyond walking. Finally, some other cost function based approaches are outlined.},

Geographers, physiologists, anthropologists, and psychologists have long been interested in the spatial and temporal aspects of navigation speed. Hikers, search and rescue teams, firefighters, the military, and others navigate on foot, and their success depends on understanding how the dynamics of foot-based navigation affect individual capabilities. This research modeled the speed of movement of humans engaged in navigation in wooded environments with varied terrain. Movement models were developed using spatiotemporal analysis of multiple subjects' trajectories. Speed estimates were collected via satellite positioning from 200 subjects engaged in foot-based navigation. Trajectory data were merged with land-cover data to analyze human navigation over varying slopes and terrain. Generalizing these characteristics provided a model of navigational speed of movement from an origin to a destination along an unknown route. Tobler's hiking function and Naismith's rule were used in an analysis of the trajectory data. The model created from this study was shown to outperform those classic human movement speed estimators by predicting route completion time within 10\% accuracy (M = 11.1min, 95\% CI [9.8, 12.4] min). These models help explain the human dynamics of navigation.]},

Pristine areas, free from human interference, cover a much smaller area (less than 32\% of Antarctica) and are declining as human activity escalates6. Urgent expansion of Antarctica's network of specially protected areas7 can both reverse this trend and secure the continent's biodiversity8--10.},

Comparative studies show remarkable differences between measured and calculated travel times obtained by available predictive procedures (Naismith's rule, Tobler's hiking function or MIDE). A new procedure has been designed by combining pre-existing methods (Tobler's and MIDE), and travel times have been calculated for 21 trails located in different protected natural areas of Spain. Times obtained are compared with travel times measured by individual users and uploaded into specialized walking-hiking websites (Wikiloc).

  abstract = {With increasing visitor numbers an understanding of the impacts of human activities in Antarctic terrestrial environments has become important. The objective of this study was to develop a means for assessing recovery of the ground surface desert pavement following physical disturbance. A set of 11 criteria were identified to assess desert pavement recovery. Assessed criteria were: embeddedness of surface clasts; impressions of removed clasts; degree of clast surface weathering; \% overturned clasts; salt on underside of clasts; development of salt coatings; armouring per m2; colour contrast; evidence of subsidence/melt out; accumulation of salt on cut surfaces; and evidence of patterned ground development. Recovery criteria were assigned a severity/extent rating on a scale from zero to four, zero being highly disturbed, and four being undisturbed. A relative \% recovery for each criteria was calculated for each site by comparison with a nearby undisturbed control area, and an overall Mean Recovery Index (MRI) was assigned to each pavement surface. To test the method, 54 sites in the Ross Sea region of Antarctica were investigated including areas disturbed by: bulldozer scraping for road-fill, contouring for infrastructure, geotechnical investigations, and experimental treading trial sites. Disturbances had occurred at timescales ranging from one week to 50 years prior to assessment. The extent of desert pavement recovery at the sites investigated in this study was higher than anticipated. Fifty of the 54 sites investigated were in an intermediate, or higher, stage of desert pavement recovery, 30 sites were in an advanced stage of recovery, and four sites were indistinguishable from adjacent control sites (MRI~=~100\%). It was found that active surfaces, such as the gravel beach deposits at the Greenpeace World Park Base site at Cape Evans, the aeolian sand deposits at Bull Pass, and the alluvial fan deposits of the Loop Moraine field campsite, recovered relatively quickly, whereas less active sites, such as the bulldozed tracks at Marble Point, and Williams Field to McMurdo Station pipeline site on Ross Island, showed only intermediate recovery 20--30 years after disturbance. The slabby grano-diorite surface material at the former Vanda Station site, meant that the impacts that had occurred were hard to detect following decommissioning of the station and site remediation. Desert pavements disturbed by randomly dispersed footprints, temporary field campsites at the Loop Moraine and VXE6 Pond in the Wright Valley, recovered to be undetectable (MRI~=~100\%) within five years, whereas track formation from repeated trampling, particularly the concentration of larger clasts along the margin of a confined track, persisted for over 15 years (MRI~=~82\%). The recovery assessment method developed in this study has environmental management applications and potential to advance our ability to predict the recovery of desert pavement following human impacts from activities in Antarctica.},

Sites included: vehicle and walking tracks at Marble Point and Taylor Valley; a campsite, experimental treading trial site, and vehicle tracks in Wright Valley; and vehicle and walking tracks at Cape Roberts. The time since last disturbance ranged from three months to over 50 years. This investigation also attempted to determine what has the greatest lasting visual impact on soil surfaces in the Ross Sea region: dispersed trafficking or track formation? Walking tracks remained visible in the landscape (due to larger clasts concentrating along track margins) long after the desert pavement surface had recovered. However, randomly dispersed footprints were undetectable within five years. For many sites, allowing widespread trampling will give lower medium-term visible impact than concentrating traffic flow by track formation. For steep slopes and sites where repeated visits occur, use of a single track is recommended. Some 1950s vehicle tracks remain visible in the Antarctic landscape, but where visually obvious impacts were remediated, evidence of former occupation was almost undetectable.},

Animal transportation networks can have direct influences on the fitness of individuals, whereas the shape and structure of transportation networks can influence community dynamics by facilitating contacts between different individuals and species. In this review, we discuss three key areas in the study of animal transportation networks: the topological properties of networks, network morphogenesis and growth, and the behaviour of network users. We present a brief primer on elements of network theory, and then discuss the different ways in which animal groups deal with the fundamental trade-off between the competing network properties of travel efficiency, robustness and infrastructure cost. We consider how the behaviour of network users can impact network efficiency, and call for studies that integrate both network topology and user behaviour. We finish with a prospectus for future research.},

Attempts to model human movement in hilly and mountainous terrain which have largely focused on least-time route transformations can be improved by incorporating research suggesting that humans systematically overestimate slopes. Such research suggests that cost functions derived from slope should be more expensive than time derivations alone would indicate. This paper presents a method for empirically estimating cost functions for slopes. We use the method to predict routes and paths that are more likely to be selected by humans based on their perceptions of slope. An evaluation of the method found that it successfully predicts road, track and trail locations over a variety of conditions and distances.},

After years of regeneration, a tendency toward reopening these areas for tourism is envisaged. Although numerous studies have documented vegetative responses to trampling disturbance, research that thoroughly examines the trampling impacts on the vegetation at different organizational levels is often limited. Most of the previous studies on the human disturbance of vegetation focused on the impacts on vascular plants, while the impacts on lichens or mosses are less well-documented. To understand how regenerated communities respond to further trampling disturbance, we repeated the experimental research on short-term trampling after 14 years in three high-altitude communities in the Tatras in northern Slovakia. According to Cole and Bayfield's protocol, we evaluated the resistance of communities trampled in 2008 and 2022, with a focus on groups of lichens and mosses and their individual species. This research brings new knowledge regarding the different behaviors of regenerated vegetation, especially lichens and mosses, to trampling disturbance. The results show that human trampling in alpine communities has a large negative impact and, therefore, management plans should discourage off-trail hiking and limit recreational activities in sensitive or reopened alpine areas.},

It turns out that only linear functions with input d; hU and hD have uniquely identifiable pace-based function counterparts.

While more complex techniques and algorithms have been developed to address the theoretical limitations of least-cost analysis, many of these are not readily accessible to typical GIS users, due to either hardware limitations or a lack of in-depth training in the theory and methods of spatial analysis. Seeking a middle ground, we test a number of simple modifications to basic least-cost analysis using the Mani peninsula in southern Greece as a case study. We assess eight procedures for calculating least-cost paths (LCPs), defining cost based on a combination of slope and the location of pre-modern pathways. These procedures are used to generate LCPs for a well-documented journey made by Colonel William Martin Leake in the year 1805. Comparing the LCPs against Leake's detailed notes and ``low-cost corridors,'' we visually assess the reliability of each model and identify likely alternative routes. We conclude that a simple modification to basic least-cost analysis -- incorporating a time-based algorithm along with traces of pre-modern footpaths and roads -- can produce robust, reliable least-cost models in other archaeological contexts where traces of pre-modern pathways can still be detected.},

With growing numbers of visitors, the Antarctic tourism industry is facing a key moment in which must find a balance between offering exclusive products to tourists who want to live a once-in-a-lifetime experience while avoiding adversely affecting the fragile balance of Antarctic ecosystems. Likewise, the Antarctic Treaty System is confronting a key moment in managing tourism to minimize environmental impacts in a time of unprecedented growth. Achieving this balance will require coordination and collaboration involving all stakeholders participating in the management and operation of the Antarctic tourism industry.},

Midwives work in moral relationships with other persons. They serve by the moral standards of their profession as now embodied in written codes of ethics, a profession that is part of the larger health care profession. As part of the professional world, midwives participate in the general standard that to be professional is to be ethical and to be unethical is to be unprofessional. The professions, in turn, are part of what Eric Fromm calls "human ethics." If midwives are to be ethical, we suggest they need to understand ethics and to reason morally. Better health care for all is the result.},

  abstract = {Abstract             This study documented land degradation resulting from initial trail development and further high-intensity touristic activity in a high-altitude setting ({$>$}4000\,m\,a.s.l.) in the Andes. Peru's Rainbow Mountain (also named Vinicunca or Monta\~na de Siete Colores) only became a world-renowned tourist destination in recent years (after 2015/2016). A high-mountain setting as such is fragile and does not recover fast, meaning the rapid influx of visitors has caused severe landscape degradation from which it will take several decades to recover. The main objectives of the study were to (1) characterise and map different types of impacts related to direct visitor pressure, (2) document and evaluate activities aimed at limiting degradation while enhancing visitors' experience, and (3) propose a conceptual model of trail functioning in the tropical high-mountain environment. Data were collected using ground-based surveys, unmanned aerial vehicles and high-resolution satellite images. We identified eight dominant morphogenetic processes responsible for the transformation of landscape surface: (1) trampling, (2) abrasion/shearing by visitors and service animals and (3) transformation of water and sediment circulation---these direct human activities can initiate and/or intensify further degradation by the following natural processes: (4) water erosion, (5) freeze--thaw cycles, (6) dry-wet cycles, (7) aeolian activities and (8) mass movements. The five main trail impacts identified were: trail widening, trail incision, formation of braided trail networks, development of muddy sections and development of informal (visitor-created) trails. These observed impacts have left a clear imprint on the landscape after just one to two seasons of intensive recreational use.},

  abstract = {Abstract             This chapter presents and discusses current approaches and trends in computer-based modelling of pathways and movement networks in archaeology. After an introduction to the theoretical concepts involved, we present a state of the art of methodologies applied for reconstructing pathways and movement in ancient landscapes and discuss the various difficulties in using these methods as well as the most important technical hurdles involved. The problems of integrating optimal pathfinding algorithms with `softer' socio-cultural variables are highlighted, as well as the limitations of modelling connections between places using least-cost path techniques. Network analysis reconstruction and analysis approaches are then reviewed as tools to better understand the overall structure of movement and communication in ancient landscapes. It is concluded that, while the potential of current approaches for understanding ancient movement is considerable, improvement is still needed in three main areas: the integration of approaches, sensitivity analysis and validation, and the theoretical underpinning of models of ancient movement.},

  abstract = {Hikers and hillwalkers typically use the gradient in the direction of travel (walking slope) as the main variable in established methods for predicting walking time (via the walking speed) along a route. Research into fell-running has suggested further variables which may improve speed algorithms in this context; the gradient of the terrain (hill slope) and the level of terrain obstruction. Recent improvements in data availability, as well as widespread use of GPS tracking now make it possible to explore these variables in a walking speed model at a sufficient scale to test statistical significance. We tested various established models used to predict walking speed against public GPS data from almost 88,000 km of UK walking / hiking tracks. Tracks were filtered to remove breaks and non-walking sections. A new generalised linear model (GLM) was then used to predict walking speeds. Key differences between the GLM and established rules were that the GLM considered the gradient of the terrain (hill slope) irrespective of walking slope, as well as the terrain type and level of terrain obstruction in off-road travel. All of these factors were shown to be highly significant, and this is supported by a lower root-mean-square-error compared to existing functions. We also observed an increase in RMSE between the GLM and established methods as hill slope increases, further supporting the importance of this variable.},
