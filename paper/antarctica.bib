  abstract = {The city is not an undifferentiated terrain and travel does not occur along straight-line paths at constant velocities. Variations in travel velocities at different locations bend the minimum time paths away from regions of high congestion. This paper discusses a transformation of the urban plane into a time surface on which distance corresponds to travel time, and describes the construction of minimum paths and isochrones for various velocity fields. This view of the urban transportation system allows us to discover some of the important features which are often hidden in a network description of the system.},

They require O(n + m) space and run in O(nm) and O(nm + n2 log n) time on unweighted and weighted networks, respectively, where m is the number of links. Experimental evidence is provided that this substantially increases the range of networks for which centrality analysis is feasible. The betweenness centrality index is essential in the analysis of social networks, but costly to compute.

  abstract = {While the benefits of GIS are widely touted among archaeologists today, less attention has been paid to the potential pitfalls and drawbacks of this undeniably important methodological tool. One of the greatest challenges of geospatial modeling is unbalanced data: due to the nature of the archaeological record, we can never assume that the remnants of past behavioral processes we are working with constitute a fully representative sample. Rather, our datasets are reflective of differential social and natural preservation conditions, as well as research biases. Most regional geospatial studies must collate diverse data collected over decades by researchers with varying backgrounds and goals, using assorted spatial scales and levels of technological sophistication. Such factors contribute substantial uncertainty to our models, uncertainty that should be recognized, quantified, and mitigated. If GIS techniques are to continue shifting the way we conduct archaeology and improve our abilities to answer questions regarding past behavior, then we must question the infallibility of GIS as a methodological tool and direct more attention toward developing robust geospatial applications that can meet the idiosyncratic needs of archaeological analysis. This paper explores one example of how such uncertainty investigation can be conducted.},

  abstract = {Complexity science refers to the theoretical research perspectives and the formal modelling tools designed to study complex systems. A complex system consists of separate entities interacting following a set of (often simple) rules that collectively give rise to unexpected patterns featuring vastly different properties than the entities that produced them. In recent years a number of case studies have shown that such approaches have great potential for furthering our understanding of the past phenomena explored in Roman Studies. We argue complexity science and formal modelling have great potential for Roman Studies by offering four key advantages: (1) the ability to deal with emergent properties in complex Roman systems; (2) the means to formally specify theories about past Roman phenomena; (3) the power to test aspects of these theories as hypotheses using formal modelling approaches; and (4) the capacity to do all of this in a transparent, reproducible, and cumulative scientific framework. We present a ten-point manifesto that articulates arguments for the more common use in Roman Studies of perspectives, concepts and tools from the broader field of complexity science, which are complementary to empirical inductive approaches. There will be a need for constant constructive collaboration between Romanists with diverse fields of expertise in order to usefully embed complexity science and formal modelling in Roman Studies.},

  abstract = {Escape routes are essential components of wildland firefighter safety, providing pre-defined pathways to a safety zone. Among the many factors that affect travel rates along an escape route, landscape conditions such as slope, lowlying vegetation density, and ground surface roughness are particularly influential, and can be measured using airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. In order to develop a robust, quantitative understanding of the effects of these landscape conditions on travel rates, we performed an experiment wherein study participants were timed while walking along a series of transects within a study area dominated by grasses, sagebrush and juniper. We compared resultant travel rates to LiDAR-derived estimates of slope, vegetation density and ground surface roughness using linear mixed effects modelling to quantify the relationships between these landscape conditions and travel rates. The best-fit model revealed significant negative relationships between travel rates and each of the three landscape conditions, suggesting that, in order of decreasing magnitude, as density, slope and roughness increase, travel rates decrease. Model coefficients were used to map travel impedance within the study area using LiDAR data, which enabled mapping the most efficient routes from fire crew locations to safety zones and provided an estimate of travel time.},

  abstract = {One of the critical factors affecting travel rates while hiking, jogging, or running along a trail is the slope of the underlying terrain. Models for predicting this effect have been used in a wide variety of scientific and applied contexts, including recreation planning, search and rescue, wildland firefighter safety, social network analysis, and recreating historical human movement patterns. Despite their wide use, these models are based on datasets with very small sample sizes that were collected without using instantaneous measures of travel rate and assume symmetrical effects about the slope of maximum travel rate. These models also typically resulted in a single mathematical function, ignoring the significant variability that can occur between a fast and a slow individual, or between walking and running travel rates. In this study we modeled travel rates using a database of GPS tracks from 29,928 individuals representing 421,247 individual hikes, jogs, and runs on trails in and around Salt Lake City, Utah for an entire year between July 1, 2016 and June 30, 2017. Three widely-used probability distribution functions (Laplace, Gauss, and Lorentz) were used to predict travel rates based on terrain slope along segments of trails with uniform slopes. To account for the variability in travel rates between fast and slow movement, a series of travel rate models were generated to predict travel rate percentiles, ranging from the 1st to the 99th, thus providing a flexible basis for predicting travel rates as a function of slope. The large number of samples allowed us to introduce a novel term that accounts for asymmetry in travel rates on uphill and downhill slopes. All three functions performed well, with Lorentz percentile models averaging an R2 of 0.958 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.078 m/s, Laplace with R2 of 0.953 and MAE of 0.088 m/s, and Gauss with R2 of 0.949 and MAE of 0.090 m/s. All three functions performed notably better at estimating lower travel rate percentiles (e.g. 5th: R2Lorentz = 0.941; R2Laplace = 0.940; R2Gauss = 0.934) as compared to higher (e.g. 95th: R2Lorentz = 0.914; R2Laplace = 0.913; R2Gauss = 0.908), indicating greater consistency in walking rates than the fastest running rates. Lorentz outperformed the other functions for the widest range of percentiles (5th, 30th-90th), and thus is recommended for use as a flexible travel rate prediction function. However, Laplace tended to produce the best results at moderately-low travel rate percentiles (10th-25th), suggesting a combination of the two models could produce the highest accuracies. The results of this research provide a sound basis for future studies aiming to estimate travel rates while hiking or running along slopes.},

Unfortunately there is a lack of communication between disciplines such as landscape ecology and transport geography. This presents a barrier to addressing geographical issues such as the spread of organisms, which in some instances require an integrated geography approach. In an attempt to encourage integrated geographical research on organism spread, that uses existing research from landscape ecology and transport geography, an integrated conceptual and technical framework is presented that could be used to produce maps that differentiate areas based on their spread potential. Conceptually, the terms patch connectivity and accessibility are recognised as being near identical in scope, and as such are suggested a useful basis for approaching the integration of movement modelling used in landscape ecology and transport geography. Technically, this integration can be achieved using modelling methodologies established in both disciplines, as the graph theory-based shortest path Dijkstra's Algorithm used in transport geography is demonstrated to be equivalent to raster GIS least-cost modelling used in landscape ecology. This conceptual and technical common ground has been used to create an analytical approach based on catchment areas that can map differing levels of spread potential across a landscape. A demonstration of how these graph theory methods can also be integrated to map spread potential as a combined function of both organism dispersal and transportation is also provided. The practical challenges and assumptions in applying the methodology are also highlighted, and to facilitate understanding and further development of the approach presented, example scripts and data for producing maps of spread potential are provided for use with a variety of software.},

Such functions are becoming more useful as apps for route guidance proliferate. Numerous practical issues are raised by any effort to validate these functions empirically. Hiking functions in general allow routes to be measured on various criteria, including travel time, travel distance, or energy consumption, yet, few efforts have been made to calibrate similar functions for other modes of travel, other traveler profiles, and other route criteria. Connected and autonomous vehicles raise the possibility that route choice may take on greater significance in the context of system-wide goals, rather than the current individual self-interest.},

It summarizes and discusses the results of a 5-year research project carried out by the editors that aimed to apply spatial dynamical modelling to reconstruct and understand the socio-economic development of the Dutch part of the Roman frontier (limes) zone, in particular the agrarian economy and the related development of settlement patterns and transport networks in the area. The project papers are accompanied by invited chapters presenting case studies and reflections from other parts of the Roman Empire focusing on the themes of subsistence economy, demography, transport and mobility, and socio-economic networks in the Roman period. The book shows the added value of state-of-the-art computer modelling techniques and bridges computational and conventional approaches. Topics that will be of particular interest to archaeologists are the question of (forced) surplus production, the demographic and economic effects of the Roman occupation on the local population, and the structuring of transport networks and settlement patterns. For modellers, issues of sensitivity analysis and validation of modelling results are specifically addressed. This book will appeal to students and researchers working in the computational humanities and social sciences, in particular, archaeology and ancient history},

It is shown that some of the functions used in archaeological least-cost path (LCP) studies do not fulfil these requirements. Nearly all LCP studies are slopebased. Therefore several slope-dependent cost functions for walkers and vehicles are discussed. Slope is often combined with some other factor, so the different methods for combining cost components are compared.

  abstract = {Each model of past movement based on historical and archaeological evidence nowadays relies implicitly or explicitly on a cost function estimating costs of movement in terms of time, calories or some other currency for the study area and period of time considered. Cost functions are the basis of two popular GIS-based areas of spatial analysis in archaeology: site catchments and least-cost paths. A site catchment is the region accessible from a site, and often archaeological studies analyse the resources within this region. A least-cost path (LCP) is the route minimizing the costs of movement between two given locations. In archaeological studies, the aim of LCP calculations is often to reconstruct ancient routes or a route network or to identify the principal factors governing the construction of known roads or road segments. For generating a site catchment, GIS programs compute an accumulated cost surface (ACS). This is also the first step for LCP generation; therefore, the Dijkstra algorithm implemented in most GIS programs for this purpose is outlined. The cost function applied for calculating the ACS typically depends on slope, soil type, vegetation cover or the presence of streams. Several slope-dependent cost functions and a list of terrain factors are presented. Moreover, issues with least-cost applications are discussed, including barrier implementation, restricted number of possible movement directions, and the calculation of slope-based costs for a path taken in one or two directions. The aim of the case study is to compare the site catchments of a Roman farm and a temple at different scales based on a cost model derived from Roman roads. The concluding section discusses validation and stability of the outcomes of the methods presented and some additional issues such as modelling movement beyond walking. Finally, some other cost function based approaches are outlined.},

Geographers, physiologists, anthropologists, and psychologists have long been interested in the spatial and temporal aspects of navigation speed. Hikers, search and rescue teams, firefighters, the military, and others navigate on foot, and their success depends on understanding how the dynamics of foot-based navigation affect individual capabilities. This research modeled the speed of movement of humans engaged in navigation in wooded environments with varied terrain. Movement models were developed using spatiotemporal analysis of multiple subjects' trajectories. Speed estimates were collected via satellite positioning from 200 subjects engaged in foot-based navigation. Trajectory data were merged with land-cover data to analyze human navigation over varying slopes and terrain. Generalizing these characteristics provided a model of navigational speed of movement from an origin to a destination along an unknown route. Tobler's hiking function and Naismith's rule were used in an analysis of the trajectory data. The model created from this study was shown to outperform those classic human movement speed estimators by predicting route completion time within 10\% accuracy (M = 11.1min, 95\% CI [9.8, 12.4] min). These models help explain the human dynamics of navigation.]},

Times obtained are compared with travel times measured by individual users and uploaded into specialized walking-hiking websites (Wikiloc).

Animal transportation networks can have direct influences on the fitness of individuals, whereas the shape and structure of transportation networks can influence community dynamics by facilitating contacts between different individuals and species. In this review, we discuss three key areas in the study of animal transportation networks: the topological properties of networks, network morphogenesis and growth, and the behaviour of network users. We present a brief primer on elements of network theory, and then discuss the different ways in which animal groups deal with the fundamental trade-off between the competing network properties of travel efficiency, robustness and infrastructure cost.

  abstract = {Slope exerts a powerful influence on the route selection processes of humans. Attempts to model human movement in hilly and mountainous terrain which have largely focused on least-time route transformations can be improved by incorporating research suggesting that humans systematically overestimate slopes. Such research suggests that cost functions derived from slope should be more expensive than time derivations alone would indicate. This paper presents a method for empirically estimating cost functions for slopes. We use the method to predict routes and paths that are more likely to be selected by humans based on their perceptions of slope. An evaluation of the method found that it successfully predicts road, track and trail locations over a variety of conditions and distances.},

  abstract = {Due to the destruction of alpine ecosystems by extreme human trampling, some alpine areas are closed to tourists. After years of regeneration, a tendency toward reopening these areas for tourism is envisaged. Although numerous studies have documented vegetative responses to trampling disturbance, research that thoroughly examines the trampling impacts on the vegetation at different organizational levels is often limited. Most of the previous studies on the human disturbance of vegetation focused on the impacts on vascular plants, while the impacts on lichens or mosses are less well-documented. To understand how regenerated communities respond to further trampling disturbance, we repeated the experimental research on short-term trampling after 14 years in three high-altitude communities in the Tatras in northern Slovakia. According to Cole and Bayfield's protocol, we evaluated the resistance of communities trampled in 2008 and 2022, with a focus on groups of lichens and mosses and their individual species. This research brings new knowledge regarding the different behaviors of regenerated vegetation, especially lichens and mosses, to trampling disturbance. The results show that human trampling in alpine communities has a large negative impact and, therefore, management plans should discourage off-trail hiking and limit recreational activities in sensitive or reopened alpine areas.},

Most known hiking-time formulas can be classified into either pace-based, requiring the elevation profile as input, or formulas having horizontal distance d, cumulative elevation gain hU and loss hD as input. In the first part of the paper, we discuss some known formulas, give a list of desirable features of such pace-based functions, discuss advantages and disadvantages of the two approaches and the connection between them. It turns out that only linear functions with input d; hU and hD have uniquely identifiable pace-based function counterparts. Then. we demonstrate how such simple linear functions with input d; hU and hD can be constructed for individuals provided enough hiking data are available, using a case study of four hikers. We also include simple adjustments for the formulas based on the elevation of start and end point of the hike. Although no statistically valid conclusions can be drawn from such a small nonrandom sample, the results still give some insight into practical questions for hikers.},

The cost function is defined on the basis of topography alone, and is defined in such a way that the cost penalty for excessively steep slopes is an adjustable parameter of the model. Least-cost paths are calculated by applying Dijkstra's algorithm to a Digital Elevation Model. Comparison of these calculated least-cost paths with existing footpaths suggests that the latter do not usually follow the least-time route, but instead optimise the metabolic cost for human locomotion. The method developed here is proposed as a means of exploring possible routes for new footpaths in mountainous areas. r 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Our intention is to design a hiking time estimation method that accounts for terrain circumstances as well as personal factors, while the level of accuracy and the simplicity of the algorithm should enable the solution to be utilised in the practice. We refine Tobler's earlier results to estimate a relation between terrain steepness and hiker's velocity. Later we use fitted curve to design our novel, personalised hiking time estimation method.},

  abstract = {Due to the proliferation of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software and the improvement of graphic user interfaces, least-cost analysis has become one of the most common tools in archaeological research for modelling movement across past landscapes. While more complex techniques and algorithms have been developed to address the theoretical limitations of least-cost analysis, many of these are not readily accessible to typical GIS users, due to either hardware limitations or a lack of in-depth training in the theory and methods of spatial analysis. Seeking a middle ground, we test a number of simple modifications to basic least-cost analysis using the Mani peninsula in southern Greece as a case study. We assess eight procedures for calculating least-cost paths (LCPs), defining cost based on a combination of slope and the location of pre-modern pathways. These procedures are used to generate LCPs for a well-documented journey made by Colonel William Martin Leake in the year 1805. Comparing the LCPs against Leake's detailed notes and ``low-cost corridors,'' we visually assess the reliability of each model and identify likely alternative routes. We conclude that a simple modification to basic least-cost analysis -- incorporating a time-based algorithm along with traces of pre-modern footpaths and roads -- can produce robust, reliable least-cost models in other archaeological contexts where traces of pre-modern pathways can still be detected.},

Peru's Rainbow Mountain (also named Vinicunca or Monta{\~n}a de Siete Colores) only became a world-renowned tourist destination in recent years (after 2015/2016). A high-mountain setting as such is fragile and does not recover fast, meaning the rapid influx of visitors has caused severe landscape degradation from which it will take several decades to recover. The main objectives of the study were to (1) characterise and map different types of impacts related to direct visitor pressure, (2) document and evaluate activities aimed at limiting degradation while enhancing visitors' experience, and (3) propose a conceptual model of trail functioning in the tropical high-mountain environment. Data were collected using ground-based surveys, unmanned aerial vehicles and high-resolution satellite images. We identified eight dominant morphogenetic processes responsible for the transformation of landscape surface: (1) trampling, (2) abrasion/shearing by visitors and service animals and (3) transformation of water and sediment circulation---these direct human activities can initiate and/or intensify further degradation by the following natural processes: (4) water erosion, (5) freeze--thaw cycles, (6) dry-wet cycles, (7) aeolian activities and (8) mass movements. The five main trail impacts identified were: trail widening, trail incision, formation of braided trail networks, development of muddy sections and development of informal (visitor-created) trails. These observed impacts have left a clear imprint on the landscape after just one to two seasons of intensive recreational use.},

After an introduction to the theoretical concepts involved, we present a state of the art of methodologies applied for reconstructing pathways and movement in ancient landscapes and discuss the various difficulties in using these methods as well as the most important technical hurdles involved. The problems of integrating optimal pathfinding algorithms with `softer' socio-cultural variables are highlighted, as well as the limitations of modelling connections between places using least-cost path techniques. Network analysis reconstruction and analysis approaches are then reviewed as tools to better understand the overall structure of movement and communication in ancient landscapes. It is concluded that, while the potential of current approaches for understanding ancient movement is considerable, improvement is still needed in three main areas: the integration of approaches, sensitivity analysis and validation, and the theoretical underpinning of models of ancient movement.},

Research into fell-running has suggested further variables which may improve speed algorithms in this context; the gradient of the terrain (hill slope) and the level of terrain obstruction. Recent improvements in data availability, as well as widespread use of GPS tracking now make it possible to explore these variables in a walking speed model at a sufficient scale to test statistical significance. We tested various established models used to predict walking speed against public GPS data from almost 88,000 km of UK walking / hiking tracks. Tracks were filtered to remove breaks and non-walking sections. A new generalised linear model (GLM) was then used to predict walking speeds. Key differences between the GLM and established rules were that the GLM considered the gradient of the terrain (hill slope) irrespective of walking slope, as well as the terrain type and level of terrain obstruction in off-road travel. All of these factors were shown to be highly significant, and this is supported by a lower root-mean-square-error compared to existing functions. We also observed an increase in RMSE between the GLM and established methods as hill slope increases, further supporting the importance of this variable.},
